# Trick-or-Treat-Visualization

![Test image](images/2.png)

Halloween Viz! As part of a data visualization assignment, we had to explore the small dataset created by Jeffrey A. Shaffer, a resident of Cincinnatti. The dataset counts the number of candies given out on Halloween by Jeffrey each year. The number of candies given to trick-or-treaters within half an hour intervals is provided. A Dashboard is created to explore some interesting relationships.
