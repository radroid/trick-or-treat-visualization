![workflow]()
Above is the expected workflow. The block highlighted in `orange` is the current position of the project.

## Project Overview
Halloween Viz! In this project, we had to explore the small dataset created by Jeffrey A. Shaffer, a resident of Cincinnatti. The dataset counts the number of candies given out on Halloween by Jeffrey each year. The dataset is combined with two other datasets to better understand the trends in the number of candies given out. A dashboard in Tableau is created to summarize the insights gained from the data.

## Goal
> **Carry out EDA and create a dashboard summarizing the most important insights gained to better understand the number of candies to be given out in a particular year.**

## Project Specifics

### Who is the audience?
The audience in this case will be Jeffrey A. Shaffer. The goal is to provide Jeffrey with a dashboard that he can exploit to determine the number of candies to buy for halloween.

#### Fictional Audience Background
Jeffrey is a resident of Cincinnati and has been keep on doing his bit to prevent global warming. He has installed solar panels and a hybrid electric grid for his house. This helps him efficiently manage his energy use. Jeffrey also works as a data scientist to educate others of the consequences of neglecting climate change and how it can be prevented. He tries his best to reduce is carbon footprint by cycling, reusing and recycling.

---

From Jeffrey's background, we can decipher that he would not want to waste candies on Halloween. Due to the pandemic caused by Covid-19, Jeffrey saw a drop in the number of trick-or-treaters. He ended up over-estimating the number of candies. He was left with over 100 candies he did not know what to do of. Therefore, he has decided to dig deeper into the data he has been collecting since 2012. He wanted to waste a minimum number of candies. In this project we help Jeffrey reduce his halloween waste.

### About the Dataset
Variables:
1. Number of candies
2. Date
3. Time

The data is collected between 6:30 and 8:15, every half an hour.

## Breaking down the Workflow
In this section, we will give a brief description of each process shown in the workflow.

### Data Collection
We will collect data from three sources

#### 1. Jeffrey's Halloween Dataset
The data was downloaded from the [dataplusscience website](https://www.dataplusscience.com/HalloweenData.html).

#### 2. IMDb Movies Dataset
This dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset).

#### 3. Cincinnati Weather Dataset
The weather data is taken from the [weather archives](https://www.weather.gov/iln/lcd_archive)

### Combining & Cleansing Data
**Tableau Prep** will be used to carry out the combining and cleansing of the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Python** (Jupyter Notebook) will be used to carry to the EDA. This will involve finding trends in the data through visualizations.

### Dashboard Creation
**Tableau** will be used to create the dashboard based on the important insights developed in the EDA that will be used by Jeffrey.

### One-Page Summary
A **Microsoft Word** document will be compiled to explain the functionality of the dashboard.


## SUPPORT
I am looking for a job ooportunity as a Software Developer and eventually Machine Learning Engineer in Canada. It would mean a lot if we could connect and discuss what we can do for each other.
